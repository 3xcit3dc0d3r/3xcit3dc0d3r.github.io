<p>  You are amazing!</p>
<p> Have a good day/night! </p>
<p> I recommend to listen to the song <strong>Blue by Yung Kai</strong>. It is a very calming and romantic song. I regard the song as a feel-good and ambient love song. I recommend it to people who like to listen to lofi music. </p>
<p> Why are you still here? </p>
