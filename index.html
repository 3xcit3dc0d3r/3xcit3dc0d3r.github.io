<h1> Hi! My name is Najma S.</h1>
<h2> I currently attend Whitney High School and am a beginner to coding.<br> I plan to study in the Computer Science field, <br> but I have not decided specifically what I want to focus on. </h2>
<p> <br>This website is what I am going to use as a portfolio for any coding projects<br> that I have, but <strong> beware, </strong> as this website may change in the future, and the<br> current projects that I am attaching are unfinished. Currently, most of my projects<br> have been made through the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.<br> Also, to access the game, press Remix on the Replit app,<br> and then press the green button on the preview tab called Run.</p>
