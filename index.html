<h1> Hi! My name is Najma Sheikh.</h1>
<h2> I am currently a sophmore at Whitney High School and am a beginner to coding. I plan to study in the Computer Science field in either AI or game design, 
but I may change my mind later on. </h2>
<p> As you may have figured, this is the website I am going to use as a portfolio for my coding project, but <strong> beware </strong>, as this website may
change in the future, and the current projects are unfinished.</p>
