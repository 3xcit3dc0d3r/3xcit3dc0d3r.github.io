<h1> Hi! My name is Najma S.</h1>
<h2> I currently attend Whitney High School and am a beginner to coding.<br> I plan to study in the Computer Science field, <br> but I have not decided specifically what I want to focus on. </h2>
<p> <br>This website is what I am going to use as a portfolio for any coding projects<br> that I have, but <strong> beware, </strong> as this website may change in the future, and the<br> current projects that I am attaching are unfinished. Currently, most of my projects<br> have been made through the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.<br> Also, to access the game, press Remix on the Replit app,<br> and then press the green button on the preview tab called Run.</p>

<p> <a href="https://replit.com/@najubanu24/Collection-Style-Game-Najma-S" <br>Here is one of my best games. Also, the premise of the<br> game is that you are attempting to prepare sandwiches for a picnic<br> with your friends, and you have to be able to catch twenty of the ingredient<br> and/or sandwiches to win and go to the picnic. </a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://replit.com/@najubanu24/CYOA-Game-Najma-S" <br>Here is another one of my best games. The premise of this game is that there is this boy called M who is going to hangout with his friends today, or not... Depending on the choices you make! <strong>Beware</strong> as this game is not finished, aka, not all the endings are there unfortunately.</a></p>
