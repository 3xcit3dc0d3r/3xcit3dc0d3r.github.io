<h1> Hi! My name is Najma S.</h1>
<h2> I currently attend Whitney High School and am a beginner to coding. I plan to study in the Computer Science field<br>in either AI or game design, but I may change my mind later on. </h2>
<p> This website is what I am going to use as a portfolio for any coding projects that I have, but <strong> beware, </strong> as this website may<br>change in the future, and the current projects that I am attaching are unfinished.</p>
